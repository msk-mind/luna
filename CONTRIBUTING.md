## Setup
To contribute by developing off the checked-out version of pyluna, run `source setup_local.sh` to set your python paths correctly.  You can then make and test your changes with this local version.
## Notes
For small changes, submit a PR, for large changes/ideas, submit an issue first for discussion.
