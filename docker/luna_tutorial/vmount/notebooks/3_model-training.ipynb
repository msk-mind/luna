    "This CLI tool has a many command line arguments. The main input is the labled tile dataset, which is the data used to train and valdiate the model. For validation, the tiles are stratified by patient id and by slide id, and the split is contoleled by the `num_splits` parameter. The `label_set` parameter is used to map the tissue types to numerical quantities. These models can use none, one, or many GPUs/CPUs using Ray. The arguments used to modify the resources are `num_gpus, num_cpus, num_workers, num_cpus_per_worker, num_gpus_per_worker`. If you want to experiment with different hyperparameters, you can supply a list of values to certian arguments, such as `learning_rate` or `batch_size` and Ray will perform a hyperparameter search or sweep accordingly. \n",
