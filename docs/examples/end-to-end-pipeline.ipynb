    "Hello, and welcome to the end-to-end tutorial! In this notebook, we will explore the workflow as a pipeline stitched together using the Snakemake software. By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to run the same workflow explored in the previous notebooks using just one command on your terminal. Although this seems ambitious, it is quite possible using Snakemake. Here are the steps we will review:\n",

    "## About Snakemake\n",
    "\n",
    "[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a workflow management software that allows users to build pipelines that can be represented using directed acyclic graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic workflow unit of Snakemake is a `rule`, defined most simply by an input, an output, and a shell command or script used to translate the input into the output. Every Snakemake project requires one `Snakefile`, which contains all of the rules for the project. By design, Snakemake will only run the first rule specified in the Snakefile. If an input to this first rule does not already exist in the project space, Snakemake will refer to other rules in the Snakefile in order to determine which sequence of rules must be run in order to produce the missing input. Given this design structure, before executing the workflow, Snakemake is able to build a directed acyclic graph in order to determine the order of the rules and any concurrencies that may persist in the pipeline (i.e. rules may be run simultaneously, rather than sequentially, if their inputs and outputs do not rely on one another). This greatly saves time in the execution process. Moreover, with this design system, it becomes quite easy to only execute part of a workflow instead of the entire process."

Note that the first rule of the Snakefile, which is by design the only rule that Snakemake will run on, is titled `rule all`. The Snakemake software will attempt to create every input necessary for this rule in order to execute the workflow. In this case, we only have one two inputs: `../outputs/visualize_tiles.done` and `../outputs/infer_tiles.done`. This is because these are the two tasks that we wish to accomplish at the end of our pipeline. Snakemake will search for ways to produce these inputs given the other rules in the Snakefile.\n",

Each of the steps in the pipeline appear as rules in this Snakefile, with a few modifications.

Each rule creates a file entitled `../outputs/rule.done` to signify the completion of the rule.\n",
