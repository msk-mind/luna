Qupath and Stardist
=======================

We provide a Qupath in a headless, dockerized form in the repository at https://github.com/msk-mind/docker/tree/master/qupath, with full GPU support.

This can be primiarly used to run Stardist, a sophisticated algorthim for nuclear segmentation and classification.  The results of the cellular segmentation can be used as inputs to e.g. the spatial statistics modules.
