About Luna
============

Luna serves as the core computational library for multi-modality oncology data analysis.


Motivation and Purpose
======================

Research in Computational oncology requires collaboration between lots of people
with different specialities. The purpose of Luna is to make the interactions between
all of these different users as seamless and easy as possible.

   Computational oncology research requires collaboration among pathologists, radiologists, 
   oncologists, bioinformatics engineers, and AI researchers. TODO: Change figure to go beyond
   just pathology
