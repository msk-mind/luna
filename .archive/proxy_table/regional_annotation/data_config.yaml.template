# file path to the source data file(s). if host is specified, the source data location is determined

# required: a full include option for rsync. Examples: --include=*.dcm --include=*.mha
# INCLUDE: 

# a file containing names of files and sub-directories that exist under the source_path of the remote system and that
# need to be transferred. One name should be placed on each line. An easy way to generate such a file is by changing
# directory to the source_path on the remote file system and executing 'ls -1 . > chunks.txt' and then moving chunks.txt
# to the destination file system.
# CHUNK_FILE: 

# total number of input data files to process. this can be obtained by running the following command on the source directory
# 'find <source_dir> -type f -name "*.dcm" -o -name "*.mha" | wc -l'
# NOTE: if you get "permission_denied" on some dirs, make sure those dirs have +x permission for "others" as this is required
# for 'find' and 'ls' operations
# FILE_COUNT: 

# total number of bytes to be transferred. this can be obtained by running the following command on the source directory
# 'find <source_dir> -type f -name "*.dcm" -o -name "*.mha" | xargs du -ac'
# DATA_SIZE: 


# limit socket I/O bandwidth. Set this limit based on available bandwidth between the source
# and destination servers. The bandwidth can be measured as follows:
# on source machine, start an iperf3 server
# $ iperf3 -s
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# Server listening on 5201
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# on the destination machine, start an iperf3 client
# iperf3 -c <source_machine> -p <listening_port>
# Connecting to host <source_machine>, port 5201
